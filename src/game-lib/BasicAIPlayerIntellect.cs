// Need to add failure criteria that is not just a hard time limit:
// Add "Red Dawn remnants" faction that gains power over time
// and generates harder missions.
// Mission failures mean support decrease.
// Once support reaches zero, game is over.
//
// So first need to add the concept of mission difficulty.
//
// -----
//
// Agents should be always occupied. Doing one of the following:
// - being sent on a mission
// - recovering from wounds
// - training to improve
// - gathering intelligence
// - generating income
//
// The AIPlayer also needs to take into account the following:
// - Are there any missions? Are they easy enough to send agents to?
// - Is there enough money in the bank? Income/Expenses are OK?
// - Are there enough agents available, or more need to be hired?
//
// -----
//
// - Try to always keep at least enough agents to maintain full transport capacity
// - Send agents on intel-gathering duty until mission is available
// - Send agents on available mission if not too hard
// - Do not hire agents if it would lead to bankruptcy
