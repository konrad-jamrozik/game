# Technical

This document contains various technical deep-dives for my own reference.

In this document `.` refers to the repository root.

## Things to do periodically

Run `npm-check-updates --upgrade` from `game/web` to update dependencies.
See e.g. [this commit](https://github.com/konrad-jamrozik/game/commit/5950149545d9894bc0a3defcb742c0cf7a55179b).

Also consider checking for unused dependencies:
